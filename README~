-->Version 1.0
**** Runs on Yt Version 3.0.1
Will just take in one file at a time and the script must be changed in order for the image desired to be rendered is a different one. 
It will do the Hue Sat Value 2 rendering and will save it as a .png file. 
Not a very fancy code, but just something to push for the meanwhile to get people started on a quick simple volume rendering script. Will be a .py file can be easily copy and pasted into an ipynb, no adjustments would have to be made

****Note: Will try to provide a sample .png file of what will be generated.
****     Still encoutnering issues with ghosting, which will give us a much nicer set of images, but until this is resolved it will be ommitted.
